          After a little brake, i came back playing, and found myself speaking
          in local chat my a guy called "Walrus" from Minnesota. During my
          absence he installed a citadel in MY-WAL solar system and was
          performing activities very similar to mine's. Shortly we became
          buddies, and during next 3-4 months we were playing together, doing:
          NPC, PI, Scanning and other things (mostly PVE).

          Although i had to respect the Silent Infinity "NRDS" rule, i was also amplifying my own diplomacy in the area: some "reds" and "blues" were added into CAEEA "diplomacy book". 
          I have also organized the transfership of NightCrew's customs to Walrus, as the NightCrew guys left the area completely.

          In order to do so, i was needing the ship with extremely large cargohold (to move the tower, fuel and structures).
          That's how "Mastodon" transport ship was dicovered by me, and after all three Serpentis towers were installed in MY-WAL and nearby solar systems.
